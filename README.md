# SYSC4906-Project
Gross Domestic Product: A poor indicator of the Wealth inequality of families due to Industrialization

## Notebooks
Stefan Rottier - cost_of_living_gdp.ipynb  
Braden Bale - HDIvsGDP_growth.ipynb  
Izunna Otiji - GDP_Unemployment.ipynb  
Paul Warhurst - MinimumWageAndGDP.ipynb  
Mathew Smith - GiniIndex_GDP.ipynb  

## Requirements
This project was developed for use with Jupyter Notebooks, and requires some dependencies to execute correctly.
In order to effectively execute the data analysis noteboooks, the following dependencies would be required:
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly

Packages are installed though Anaconda Prompt using `conda install package-name`

## Usage
The included Notebooks each represent an analysis of a particular Hypothesis, which as a collection, provide a comprehensive exploration of the higher level proposal: GDP is a poor indicator of wealth inequality for individual families. By executing and following through the analysis of each Hypothesis, this repository aims to prove this claim.

### Interactivity
To enhance the visualization experience for some of the analysis, the following Google Collab was configured:

## Datasets
The raw datasets that are used for the analysis in these notebooks have been sourced from various open data sources. These raw data collections have been saved in .CSV format within the `/datasets` directory of this repository, or found at https://github.com/bradenbale/SYSC4906-Project/tree/main/datasets. Through the execution of the notebooks, these raw data sources are cleaned and processed for their usage in the analysis of the respective Hypothesis that was being explored.
