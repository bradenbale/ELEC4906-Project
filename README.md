### Gross Domestic Product: A Poor Indicator of a Nation’s Overall Performance as Experienced by its Citizens

The Gross Domestic Product per capita of a nation is often treated as the most important measure of a country’s economic performance. However, this use is misleading and suggests that the GDP of a nation is equally distributed among a country’s inhabitants. The experience of the individuals composing the nation is disregarded. Using datasets  containing information about national GDP, Real Minimum Wage, Wealth Inequality, Unemployment and Household Disposable Income over time, this project analyzed the effect of GDP  on the individuals in more detail. This analysis found that the use of GDP per capita alone is insufficient when analyzing the economical experience of the individuals. 

## Notebooks
To more thoroughly explore how this project was completed, and how the insights were derived, the following notebooks were developed.

Stefan Rottier - cost_of_living_gdp.ipynb  
Braden Bale - HDIvsGDP_growth.ipynb  
Izunna Otiji - GDP_Unemployment.ipynb  
Paul Warhurst - MinimumWageAndGDP.ipynb  
Mathew Smith - GiniIndex_GDP.ipynb  

## Requirements
This project was developed for use with Jupyter Notebooks, and requires some dependencies to execute correctly.
In order to effectively execute the data analysis noteboooks, the following dependencies would be required:
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly

Packages are installed though Anaconda Prompt using `conda install package-name`

## Usage
The included Notebooks each represent an analysis of a particular Hypothesis, which as a collection, provide a comprehensive exploration of the higher level proposal: GDP is a poor indicator of wealth inequality for individual families. By executing and following through the analysis of each Hypothesis, this repository aims to prove this claim.

### Interactivity
To enhance the visualization experience for some of the analysis, the following Google Collab was configured:

## Datasets
The raw datasets that are used for the analysis in these notebooks have been sourced from various open data sources. These raw data collections have been saved in .CSV format within the `/datasets` directory of this repository, or found at https://github.com/bradenbale/SYSC4906-Project/tree/main/datasets. Through the execution of the notebooks, these raw data sources are cleaned and processed for their usage in the analysis of the respective Hypothesis that was being explored.
